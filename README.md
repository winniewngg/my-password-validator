# CIS 3500 — Password Validator Starter Code

This repository contains the starter code for the second part of Penn CIS 3500's **Password Validator** exercise:

1. In the first part, you tested a password validator API endpoint

2. In this second part, you will implement a simple password validator and deploy it.

## Instructions

### Initial Deployment

1. Fork (or import/copy) this repository to your own GitHub account, keep the name `my-password-validator`.

2. Sign-up for an account at [Render.com](https://www.render.com/). For this entire exercise, the free tier is sufficient.

3. Once you are logged in to Render's dashboard, click on the `+ Add new` button and select `Blueprint`:

4. In the following form, scroll down, and select `Public Git Repository` and choose the repository you forked in step 1. Please note:

    - Render can deploy from a public repository, or, if you connect your GitHub account to Render and provide the necessary permission, from a private repository. Here, for simplicity, we are using the _public repository_ option.

    - **One consequence of using the `Public Git Repository` option is that you will have to manually trigger a new deployment every time you push new code to your repository.** If you want to automate at a later point, you can connect your GitHub account to Render and use the _GitHub integration_ option.

    - We are using the **Infrastructure as Code** approach, where the configuration for the deployment is stored in the repository itself, in the file `render.yaml` using Render's Blueprint format (see [full documentation here](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec)). This is a best practice, as it allows you to version-control your deployment configuration. **For this reason, you should not have to provide any configuration beyond the URL to your GitHub repository.**

5. Once your app has been added, Render will start building and deploying an initial release. You can see the progress in the dashboard. Once it is done, you will see a URL for your app. Click on it to see your app live.

> Hello from my Password Validator! — `lumbroso@seas.upenn.edu`

6. Don't forget to change the `AUTHOR` variable in the `main.py` file to your own Penn email address!

### Local Development

The above instructions should help you deploy this project to Render. However, you may want to run the project locally for development purposes.

To do so, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.

1. Clone your repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's directory.

3. Use `pipenv` (you may have to install it: `pip install pipenv`) to install the project's dependencies:

    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

    The benefit of using `pipenv` is that it transparently creates a virtual environment for each of your project, so you don't have to worry about dependencies conflicting with other projects.

4. Once the dependencies are installed (`flask` and `gunicorn`), you can activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    pipenv run gunicorn main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:1234
    ```

    The above command will start a local server on port 1234. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:1234` in your browser.


### Testing the Endpoint

https://my-password-validator-c0e9.onrender.com

**Browser test:** Go to https://password-validator.onrender.com/; you should see the "`Hello from my Password Validator!`" text.

**Endpoint test:** You can test the password validation endpoint by sending a POST request with a JSON body. For example, using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"Abc12345"}' \
  https://password-validator.onrender.com/checkPassword
```

This should initially return `{"reason":"Not implemented","valid":false}`.

You can also use a tool like [RapidAPI](https://paw.cloud/) for macOS, or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), for  to send the request.


### Assignment

**THE SPECIFIC PASSWORD POLICY TO IMPLEMENT WILL BE COMMUNICATED IN CLASS. PLEASE FOLLOW CAREFULLY.**

The goal of the assignment is to implement a password validation endpoint that checks if a password is valid or not. The endpoint should be available at `/v1/checkPassword` and should accept a POST request with a JSON body that looks like this:

```json
{
    "password": "my-password"
}
```

The response should be a JSON object with a two keys, `valid`, that is `true` if the password is valid and `false` otherwise; and `reason`, a string that explains why the password is invalid (this string is always present, but empty when the password is valid).

Initially all passwords are considered invalid, and the app returns an HTTP status code of 501 (Not Implemented). You should implement the password validation logic in the `main.py` file, and ensure the returned HTTP status code is 200 at all times (even when the password is invalid).

## Creating a Test Suite

1. You can add tests by adding the `pytest` package:

    ```bash
    pipenv install pytest --dev
    ```

2. Add your tests to a `test_main.py` file (the tool `pytest` automatically looks for files that start with `test_` or that are in the `tests` directory):

    ```python
    # test_main.py
    import pytest
    from main import app


    @pytest.fixture
    def client():
        """
        Pytest fixture that creates a Flask test client from the 'app' in main.py.
        """
        with app.test_client() as client:
            yield client


    def test_root_endpoint(client):
        """
        Test the GET '/' endpoint to ensure it returns
        the greeting and a 200 status code.
        """
        resp = client.get("/")
        assert resp.status_code == 200
        assert b"Hello from my Password Validator!" in resp.data


    # Not that this test only makes sense for the starter code,
    # in practice we would not test for a 501 status code!

    def test_check_password_not_implemented(client):
        """
        Test the POST '/v1/checkPassword' endpoint to ensure
        it returns HTTP 501 (Not Implemented) in the starter code.
        """
        resp = client.post("/v1/checkPassword", json={"password": "whatever"})
        assert resp.status_code == 501
        data = resp.get_json()
        assert data.get("reason") == "Not implemented"
        assert data.get("valid") is False
    ```

3. You can run them with:

    ```bash
    pipenv run pytest
    ```

    This will run all the tests in the `test_main.py` file.
